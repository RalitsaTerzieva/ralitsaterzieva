### Hi there 👋,

👋 Hi, I'm Rali, a Software Engineer 🧑‍💻 working on projects based on Python/Django 🐍 and JavaScript/React/React Native ⚛️.

- 🔍 Currently seeking a position where I can leverage my skills in Python/Django and React/React Native.

- 💻 I am currently building personal projects with React Native/React/NextJs/GraphQl.

- 📚 Apart from coding, I am a huge fan of books and enjoy diving into them in my free time.
