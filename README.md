👋 Hi, 
I'm Rali, a Software Engineer 🧑‍💻 passionate about working on projects with Python/Django 🐍 and JavaScript/React/React Native ⚛️.

🔍 Currently seeking a position where I can leverage my skills in React/React Native and/or Python/Django while expanding my knowledge in AWS cloud services.

💻 I am currently building personal projects with React Native/React/Next.js/GraphQL and enhancing my expertise in AWS to create scalable and efficient cloud solutions.

📚 Apart from coding, I am a huge fan of books and enjoy diving into them in my free time.
